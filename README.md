# PepsiCo (PEP) Financial Model & Valuation

**Project Overview**
This repository contains a dynamic **3-Statement Financial Model** and **DCF Valuation** for PepsiCo Inc. The model forecasts financial performance through 2030, incorporating complex debt schedules, capital structure analysis, and sensitivity testing to determine the intrinsic value of the stock.

**Key Features**
* **3-Statement Integration:** Fully linked Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement with a self-balancing check.
* **Debt Schedule with Revolver:** Modeled a circular "Revolver Mechanism" to automatically handle cash deficits and calculate interest on average debt balances.
* **Capital Asset Schedule:** Detailed PP&E roll-forward separating Growth Capex vs. Maintenance Capex to analyze capital intensity.
* **DCF Valuation:** Discounted Cash Flow analysis using WACC (6.9%) and Terminal Growth (2.0%) to derive an intrinsic share price range.
* **Sensitivity Analysis:** Data tables testing the impact of WACC and Terminal Growth variations on Enterprise Value.

**Dashboard Highlights**
* **De-leveraging Profile:** Visualized Net Debt/EBITDA ratios dropping from ~2.4x to <1.5x by 2030.
* **Investment Efficiency:** Capex vs. Depreciation analysis confirming Pepsi's "Growth Phase" investment strategy.
* **Valuation Football Field:** A summary chart comparing 52-week trading ranges against Bear, Base, and Bull DCF scenarios.

**Technical Skills Demonstrated**
* **Advanced Excel:** Iterative calculations (Circularity), Offset functions, Data Tables, and Index/Match.
* **Financial Analysis:** Ratio analysis (ROIC, Interest Coverage), Working Capital management (DSO/DPO/DIO), and Capital Structure optimization.

**Conclusion**
The model suggests a Base Case intrinsic value of **$160 - $180**, implying the stock is currently trading at fair value with a strong defensive liquidity profile.
